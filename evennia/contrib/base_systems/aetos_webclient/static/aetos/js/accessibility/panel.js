/*
 * Aetos accessibility mode and its options.  A9, then A10.
 *
 * One visible control that switches between the standard interface and the
 * accessible one, and the picker that belongs to the second.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. The preferences it shows are not new -- every one has worked
 * since the A-track built it, and every one is in Settings. The problem was that
 * they sat across five groups of a panel reached from the command palette, and
 * **almost nobody would ever find them**. Granularity was right and it created a
 * discovery problem.
 *
 * WHAT THE TOGGLE DOES. A9 shipped it as a disclosure: the panel hid and every
 * setting stayed applied. Gary asked for the sharper version -- two modes, "so
 * we dont have to try to be everything to everybody" -- and that is A10.
 * Standard mode stops the governed accommodations applying. Accessible mode
 * resumes them.
 *
 * IT MASKS; IT NEVER ERASES. Switching to standard leaves every stored value
 * untouched, so switching back restores the interface somebody built rather than
 * a fresh one. That is what makes the switch safe to try, and it is the whole
 * difference between a mode and a reset.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT GOVERNED BY IT. Keyboard operation, focus management, landmarks,
 * accessible names, the announcer, colour never carrying meaning alone. Those
 * are unconditional in both modes and are listed in the panel as such --
 * somebody deciding whether to switch deserves to know what was never off.
 *
 * Three of the panel's own options are not governed either, because their
 * defaults are the *less* accessible value: reverting gestures, mute or
 * orientation help would impose an accommodation's opposite on the person who
 * asked for it. See `revertsInStandardMode` in preferences.js.
