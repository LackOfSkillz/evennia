/*
 * Aetos accessibility manager.  Addendum A.4.
 *
 * Composes the four pieces of the foundation -- preferences, announcements,
 * focus and shortcuts -- and applies the visual preferences to the document.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SUBSYSTEM AND NOT A UTILITY FILE. Accessibility behaviour that
 * lives as scattered helpers gets partially applied: one widget honours reduced
 * motion, the next forgets, and nobody notices because the person who would
 * notice is not in the room. Making it a subsystem with one entry point means a
 * widget cannot forget, because the widget is not the thing deciding.
 *
 * A.4 also requires that accessibility code read the same canonical state store
 * as the visual widgets rather than scraping rendered text. That rule is why
 * this file takes services rather than reaching into the DOM for game state:
 * an accessible view is a *peer* presentation of the same state, never a
 * transcription of the visual one.
 *
 * PREFERENCES BECOME ATTRIBUTES, NOT CLASSES ON EVERY ELEMENT. The manager sets
 * a handful of `data-aetos-*` attributes on the root element and CSS does the
 * rest. That keeps the styling decisions in the stylesheet, where a theme can
 * see and honour them, instead of hard-coded in JavaScript where a theme cannot.
