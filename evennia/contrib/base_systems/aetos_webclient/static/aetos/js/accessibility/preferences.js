/*
 * Aetos accessibility preferences.  Addendum A.70, A.71, A.72.
 *
 * THERE IS A MODE, AND IT DOES NOT REACH THE BASELINE (A10).
 *
 * `shell.mode` chooses between the standard interface and the accessible one.
 * It governs the *optional* layer only -- contrast, type size, motion,
 * stimulation, verbosity, quiet and focus modes, the word board.
 *
 * Semantic HTML, keyboard operation, focus management, landmarks, accessible
 * names and the announcer are unconditional, are not represented in this file
 * at all, and cannot be turned off by a player or a game developer
 * (A11Y-BASE-001). A mode switch that could reach them would not be a mode
 * switch; it would be a way to break the client.
 *
 * This file said "there is no accessibility mode here" until A10, and for the
 * baseline that is still exactly true. What changed is that the optional layer
 * now has one, because trying to be everything to everybody at once produced an
 * interface that was nobody's first choice.
 *
 * What lives here is the part that genuinely varies between people: how much
 * the client should say out loud, how much it should move, and how much it
 * should help with orientation. Choosing a screen-reader profile adjusts
 * verbosity. It does not "turn accessibility on" (A.71).
 *
 * TWO STORES, ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * The canonical copy lives in the `preferences` namespace, so it is exported,
 * imported and counted by the privacy panel like everything else the player
 * owns (A.75).
 *
 * A mirror lives in the boot channel, because several of these settings decide
 * how the client should look *before* the database has opened. Reading them
 * late would mean a player who asked for no motion sees motion first, which is
 * precisely the harm the setting exists to prevent.
 *
 * The mirror is a cache and the namespace is the truth. They are reconciled on
 * boot in that direction.
 *
 * NEVER LEAVES THE BROWSER (A.72, A.73, A.74). Nothing here is sent to the game
 * server, and Aetos does not attempt to detect a screen reader, a braille
 * display or AAC use. That detection would be fingerprinting, and a player must
 * never have to disclose a disability to a MUD operator in order to play.

     * What the accessibility panel offers.  A9.
     *
     * This table is the deliverable of A9 as much as the panel is: it draws the
     * line between the accommodations a player chooses and the ones that are
     * simply how the client is built.
     *
     * Everything here is **optional and opinionated** -- a matter of need and
     * taste, which a player might reasonably not want. Nothing here is load
     * bearing for basic operation.
     *
     * `kind` says how to render it; `label` is what a player reads; `detail`
     * says what changes, in terms of what they will see rather than what the
     * code does.
     *
     * `revertsInStandardMode` is the one that needs care. A10 makes standard
     * mode stop applying the accommodations, and something may only be reverted
     * safely if its **default is the standard experience** -- so that reverting
     * removes an accommodation rather than imposing one.
     *
     * Four here are marked `false`. `visual.scale` is the odd one and the most
     * important: being able to set the size of text is not an accommodation
     * somebody opts into, it is a basic property of a text interface, so it is
     * offered in *both* modes and survives the switch. The other three fail the
     * test above:
     *
     *   `pointer.gestures` defaults to ON, so somebody with a tremor turns them
     *   OFF. Reverting would switch gestures back on for the person who most
     *   needed them off.
     *
     *   `audio.muted` defaults to OFF, so muting is the accommodation.
     *   Reverting would start playing sound at somebody.
     *
     *   `cognitive.reorientEnabled` defaults to ON. Reverting adds a feature
     *   rather than removing one, which is not what a mode switch is for.
     *
     * They stay in the panel, because they belong there, and they survive the
     * mode switch untouched. Getting this backwards would make standard mode
     * actively hostile to three of the people it is meant to leave alone.
